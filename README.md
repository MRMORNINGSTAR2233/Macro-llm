To provide step-by-step instructions for referencing `train.py` in your README.md file, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the `train.py` file in your preferred text editor.
2. Copy the file path of `train.py` (e.g., `/path/to/train.py`).
3. In your README.md file, create a code block using triple backticks (```) to enclose the file path.
4. Add the appropriate language identifier after the opening triple backticks to specify the code language (e.g., `python`).
5. Paste the file path inside the code block.

Here's an example of how the markdown would look like:

```python
/path/to/train.py
```

Make sure to replace `/path/to/train.py` with the actual file path of `train.py` on your system.
